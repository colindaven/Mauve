TranslatedSequencePanel is the top-level element that needs to be added
to the mauve GUI.  The sequence panel has, most importantly, a sequence
to be rendered, and a renderer to renderer it.  It also has some doodads
to control the part of the sequence being rendered.

Using MultiLineRenderer as the rendered for a TranslatedSequencePanel
allows for the rendering of multiple views of the same sequence.

The blocks for the features are created using the FeatureBlockSequenceRenderer.
The FeatureBlockSequenceRenderer delegated the rendering of features to FeatureRenderers,
which actually go about doing the drawing (using a Graphics2D object, the feature, etc).
These FeatureBlockSequenceRenderers are then wrapped up in a FeatureFilter, that only causes
select features to be rendered by each particular FeatureRenderer.
